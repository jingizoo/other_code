Subject: New MS-ENH Jira Project Requested & FinSys BAU Kanban Board Now Live – Next Steps

Hi Team,

To improve visibility—and ensure every hour is captured correctly in Tempo—we are rolling out two tracking streams:

Stream	Where it Lives	Board Type	Status	Scope
Managed Services Enhancements (MS-ENH)	New Jira project (request submitted)	Scrum	Awaiting provisioning	All enhancement work delivered under the 500-hour bucket
FinSys BAU Support	Existing FinSys project – BAU Kanban board	Kanban	Live now	Koopa, Kyriba, TARDIS and other day-to-day BAU tasks


⸻

What’s happening
	1.	MS-ENH project
Requested from Jira Admins. I’ll share the link and run a quick walkthrough as soon as it’s provisioned.
	2.	FinSys BAU Kanban board
Already created in the existing FinSys project and ready for use today. Start logging BAU tickets here immediately—no new project setup required.

⸻

How you can help

Action	Who	When
Start raising / moving BAU tickets to the new Kanban board	All FinSys BAU members	Effective immediately
Nominate one PoC per sub-team to validate board workflows & help migrate any open items	Team Leads	By EOD Friday
Log effort in Tempo (MS-ENH once live, BAU Kanban now)	Everyone	Ongoing
Send feedback / questions so we can fine-tune the setup	Anyone	Anytime

I’ll schedule a 30-minute orientation session once the MS-ENH project goes live and share a quick video snippet for the BAU Kanban board by tomorrow.

Thanks in advance for your support—looking forward to making this transition smooth for everyone.

Best regards,
Jalaj
Managed Services & FinSys BAU Lead
