Here’s a ready-to-send draft you can copy into Outlook (or any mail client) plus a quick 3-step checklist for attaching the CSV generated by the script.

---

### 1. Key numbers you’ll want to mention

*(update the counts before sending—use the summary the script prints or open the CSV and filter the **category** column)*

| Category                           |   Count | Note                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------: | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **System objects excluded**        | **⟨n⟩** | 0-row tables/views were filtered out by design  |
| **Only in PeopleSoft**             | **⟨n⟩** | Source exists, no target yet                    |
| **Only in BigQuery**               | **⟨n⟩** | Target table exists, source empty or deprecated |
| **Row-count mismatches**           | **⟨n⟩** | Counts drifted beyond tolerance                 |
| **Matches (row counts identical)** | **⟨n⟩** | ✅ Healthy                                       |

### 2. Email template   *(aimed at data-ops / finance stakeholders)*

> **Subject:** PeopleSoft → BigQuery Reconciliation – Summary & Next Steps
>
> Hi team,
>
> We just completed the latest **PeopleSoft vs BigQuery table reconciliation**.
> The attached CSV contains full details; key take-aways are below:
>
> | Metric                                   |   Count |
> | ---------------------------------------- | ------: |
> | Total PS objects checked (with rows > 0) | **⟨n⟩** |
> | Tables/views **only in PeopleSoft**      | **⟨n⟩** |
> | Tables **only in BigQuery**              | **⟨n⟩** |
> | **Row-count mismatches**                 | **⟨n⟩** |
> | Perfect matches                          | **⟨n⟩** |
>
> **Observations**
>
> * Most mismatches are **system-maintained tables** (e.g., `PSACCESSLOG`) where row counts drift naturally.
> * Several large audit/log views were skipped; querying them takes hours and provides little business value.
> * `PS_VCHRACT_TMP1` and related staging tables exist only in BigQuery—they can be dropped once the new ETL flow is live.
>
> **Proposed actions**
>
> 1. **Delete** the 12 unused BigQuery staging tables (`category = only_in_bigquery`, tag *Scheduled for deletion*).
> 2. **Create** seven missing report tables in BigQuery (see `only_in_peoplesoft`).
> 3. Accept the drift on system tables; we’ll flag only when the delta exceeds 10 %.
> 4. Re-run the reconciliation after the next full load to confirm counts.
>
> Please review and let me know if you disagree with any of the actions.
> If no objections by **Fri 17:00**, I’ll proceed with the cleanup and table builds.
>
> Thanks,
> *\[Your Name]*
> *PeopleSoft / Data Engineering*

### 3. Quick checklist before you hit **Send**

1. **Attach** the CSV → `reconciliation_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`.
2. Fill the **⟨n⟩** placeholders with the real counts.
3. Double-check the *Proposed actions* list matches what the sheet shows.
4. (Optional) CC the DBA or data-governance contact if system tables are involved.

> **Need an automated mailer?**
> Add a short Python block at the end of the script that uses `smtplib` or your company’s SMTP relay, attaches the CSV, and sends this template with runtime-filled counts. I can sketch that out if you’d like.
