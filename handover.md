**Subject:** PeopleSoft â†’ GCP Archiving: Dev Reconciliation Clean âœ… | Request to Proceed with Prod

Hi Everyone,

The first end-to-end archive cycle for the **CIG-Accounting *Dev*** environment is wrapped up and the reconciliation report came back *clean*â€”no missing rows, no count mismatches. ðŸŽ‰
Youâ€™ll find the recon workbook attached, along with a short explainer of the validation logic.

### Next steps

1. **Peer sign-off**
   *Please skim the attached reconciliation workbook and ping me if you spot anything odd by **tomorrow EOD**.*

2. **Promote to Prod**

   * Once I get the thumbs-up, Iâ€™ll replicate the same Terraform state, ETL config, and monitoring setup in the **Production** project.
   * Iâ€™ll also refresh the Tableau workbook to point at the prod Parquet buckets.

3. **Final validation**

   * After the initial prod run, weâ€™ll rerun the recon script and circulate the report for a quick sanity check.

Let me know if you need anything clarified. Thanks in advance for the quick review so we can keep the prod timeline on track.

Best,
