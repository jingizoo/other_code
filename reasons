| **To be deleted from bq**                                                                        | **Scheduled for deletion in BigQuery – table no longer required.**                                         |
| **Available in PS but not reconciled, as for some view row count query takes hours to complete** | **Present in PeopleSoft; reconciliation deferred – counting rows on the view is prohibitively slow.**      |
| **To be deleted doesn't exist in AD. Copied from DB**                                            | **Scheduled for deletion – object not present in AD; retained only as a one-off copy from the source DB.** |
