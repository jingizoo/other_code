| **Ignored due to attachment data. Please advise if we backup attachments as documents** | **Skipped – contains BLOB/attachment payloads.<br>Load only if an attachment-backup strategy is defined.** |
| **Ignored as this is a log table and large size**                                       | **Skipped – high-volume audit/log table; size is prohibitive for routine loads.**                          |
| **Special handling required for ingestion. Ignored. Can be considered if important**    | **Deferred – requires specialised ingestion (e.g., CDC/streaming). Load on demand if business-critical.**  |
| **Too large. Can be extracted if required**                                             | **Deferred – very large dataset; ingest only on request.**                                                 |
